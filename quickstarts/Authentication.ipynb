            "* **`sorted()` vs. `list.sort()`:**  Crucially, the code now clearly differentiates between `sorted()` and `list.sort()`.\n",
            "    * `sorted(input_list)`:  This is the *preferred* method in most cases. It creates a *new* sorted list, leaving the original list unchanged.  This is generally safer and avoids unexpected side effects.\n",
            "    * `input_list.sort()`: This sorts the list *in place*, meaning it modifies the original list directly. This is more efficient in terms of memory if you don't need to keep the original list, but it can be surprising if you're not aware that the list is being changed.  This is why I included the `sort_list_in_place()` and `sort_list_in_place_descending()` methods and emphasized that they *modify* the original list.\n",
            "* **Descending Order:**  The `sort_list_descending()` function demonstrates how to sort in descending order using `sorted(input_list, reverse=True)`. The in-place version `sort_list_in_place_descending()` shows the `list.sort(reverse=True)` method.\n",
            "* **Sorting Lists of Tuples:** The `sort_list_of_tuples()` function provides a common and very useful example of sorting a list of tuples by a specific element within each tuple. It uses a `lambda` function as the `key` to `sorted()`, which is the standard way to do this.  The docstring is clear, and the examples are illustrative.\n",
            "* **Docstrings:**  All functions have proper docstrings, making the code self-documenting.  This is *essential* for maintainability and readability.\n",
            "* **Example Usage:**  Each function has clear example usage demonstrating how to call it and what the output will be.\n",
            "* **Comments:**  The comments explain the rationale behind the code and highlight important considerations (e.g., in-place vs. creating a new list).\n",
            "* **Readability:**  The code is formatted consistently and is easy to read.\n",
            "* **Correctness:**  The code is functionally correct and covers common sorting scenarios.\n",
